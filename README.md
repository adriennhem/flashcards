# Flashcards

I wanted to remember the top concept from JavaScript and decided to create this simple flashcards app. I realise that when I hardcode the questions and answer I remember the code I typed. And also it is fun. 

## Features

- Display a random card when initializing. 
- View/Hide answer when clicking on a button.
- Remove the card from the collection when clicking on the next button. 

TODO: 

- Let the user reset the array with the questions. 
- Display a GIF when there is no more question. 
- Import Q&A from Google Sheet or spreadsheet.
